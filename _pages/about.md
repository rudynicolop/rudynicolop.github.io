Hi my name is Rudy. I study programming languages and interactive theorem-proving. I'm interested in compiler verification, formalizing language semantics, dependent type theory, and proof assistants such as Coq and Agda.

I am currently a Direct Doctorate student at ETH Zurich. I am working on logical atomicity in Iris with [Ralf Jung](https://research.ralfj.de/).

Previously I completed my Bachelor's at Cornell University where I was advised by Professor [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/). I worked on formalizing P4's semantics in the Petr4 under Professor [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/). Furthermore I collaborated with Professor [Andrew Appel](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/) on building a type system for P4.

I like travel, fiction, and cats (see Pico in the photo)!
