Hi my name is Rudy. I'm an incoming student at ETH Zurich. I study programming languages and formal verification. I'm interesting in compiler verification, formalizing language semantics, dependent type theory, and proof assistants such as Coq and Agda.

Previously I completed my Bachelor's at Cornell University where I was advised by Professor Adrian Sampson. I worked on formalizing P4's semantics in the Petr4 under Professor Nate Foster. Furthermore I collaborated with Professor Andrew Appel on building a type system for P4.

I love reading, travel, and music.
