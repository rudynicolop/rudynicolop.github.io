Hi my name is Rudy. I study programming languages and interactive theorem-proving. I'm interested in separation logic, dependent type theory, and proof assistants such as Rocq, Lean, and Agda. I will be starting a PhD at EPFL in February 2026.

I am a Master's student at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Currently, I am working on mechanizing weighted formal language theory in Lean, supervised by [Franz Nowak](https://rycolab.io/authors/franz/) and [Juan Luis Gastaldi](https://rycolab.io/authors/gianni/). I completed my Master's thesis [*A Program Logic for Tree Borrows*](http://rudynicolop.github.io/publications/2025-09-19-tree-borrows), a mechanized program logic in Iris, and experimented with logical atomicity in Iris, both supervised by Ralf Jung.

Previously I completed my Bachelor's at Cornell University where I was advised by Professor [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/). I worked on formalizing P4's semantics in Rocq for the Petr4 and Poulet4 projects under Professor [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/). Furthermore I collaborated with Professor [Andrew Appel](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/) on building a type system for P4 in Rocq.

I like travel and cats (see Pico in the photo)!
