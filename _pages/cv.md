Research Experience
======
**Logical Atomicity in Iris**\
Aug 2024 - Present: Student Researcher\
Mentor: [Ralf Jung](https://research.ralfj.de/)\
Working on replacing the coinductive definition of logically-atomic hoare triples in Iris to relieve clients' proof burden to show that atomic updates are preserved in abort cases.

[Poulet4 Project](https://github.com/verified-network-toolchain/petr4)\
Jan 2021 - Aug 2023: Research Programmer\
Mentors: [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/), [Andrew Appel](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/)\
Implemented in Coq the p4cub IR for a verified p4 compiler, including type soundness & semantics-preserving transformations on the IR.\
Wrote the type system in Coq for the p4light IR, including type soundness proofs.

**Petr4 Project**\
Jan 2019 - Aug 2020 : Undergrad Research Assistant\

Rigorously defined the static semantics of the network programming language p4 in terms of an operational semantics.\
Contributed to OCaml-written type-checker.
